# tng-carts
An update of the mod "AstikorCarts for TFC:TNG for Minecraft 1.12.2" for TFC:TNG and Minecraft 1.18.x
Many thanks to the original author/project: https://github.com/issork/astikor-carts

The goal of this project is to get a functional version of AstikorCarts working and integrated with TFC:TNG's tech tree.

I envision carts being useful for creating paths, tilling dirt, moving log/ingot/etc. stacks, barrels, and other heavy TFC items.

We may optionally it more difficult to do things without the carts to encourage their use.
